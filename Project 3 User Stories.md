# Project 3
1. As a user, I should be able to see and visit the most recent listings through the home page because the textbook I am looking at might not have any listings, so being able to see the newest listings would be nice because a new listing for the textbook might be created.
2. As a user taking a popular class, I should be able to see and visit the most viewed listings through the home page.
3. As a user, I want to be able to view the details of a specific listing on its own details page.
4. As a user, I want to be able to view all of the available listings of a textbook by going to the details page of that textbook.
5. As a user, I want to be able to view a seller's profile from the listing details page so I can easily obtain their contact information.
