# Project 3
1. As a user, I should be able to see and visit the most recent listings through the home page because the textbook I am looking at might not have any listings, so being able to see the newest listings would be nice because a new listing for the textbook might be created.
2. As a user taking a popular class, I should be able to see and visit the most viewed listings through the home page.

6. As a user, I want to be able to view the details of a specific textbook on its own details page, and on the same page, view the available listings for that textbook, if any exist.
7. As a user, I want to be able to view the details of a course on its own details page, and on the same page, view the textbooks required for that course.
