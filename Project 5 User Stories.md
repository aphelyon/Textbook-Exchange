# Project 5
1. As a user, I should be able to search for textbooks to buy.
2. As a user, I should be able to know the seller of the textbook I searched for.
3. As a user, I should still be able to search for listings without logging in. 
4. As a seller, new listings I add should appear in the search page.
5. As a seller, I should be able to check all the listings I put up for sale.
6. As a user, I should be able to see the price of a textbook that I search for before I view its listing page.
