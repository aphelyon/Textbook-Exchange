# Project 5
1. As a user, I should be able to search for textbooks to buy.
2. As a user, I should be able to know the seller of the textbook I searched for. 
3. As a user, I should still be able to search for listings without logging in. 
4. As a seller, the listing I put out should appear in the search page.
5. As a seller, I should be able to check all the listings I put out for sell.
